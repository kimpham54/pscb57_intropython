    "Hi all, i'm kim pham and im' here to give you a very brief primer on programming in python. believe it or not, i'm a librarian, actually the physics librarian here at utsc, which might seem strange to you that i'm teaching you how to code. Personally, I am by no means an expert coder but I do get to code from time to time in my work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library and the librarians including myself are available to help you with what you might think of as traditional library help such as finding research materials such as journal articles and books (both online or in print), help using and accessing journal databases, help to critically evaluate media and online information sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now If I were to generalize that statement further, the library is here to help students develop the skills to understand data and information and perform tasks in digital environments [and with technology (digital literacy). ].\n",
    "\n",
    "And so this includes teaching you how to code, because coding involves understanding how to use and manipulate data and then trying to automate the tasks of working with data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Programs are everywhere on your computer and on the internet. Every time you use a web browser, play a computer game or write a text message on your cell phone, you're using a program. Even your operating system, such as OSX, Linux or Windows is a program. A program is just a set of instructions that is run or executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Programs, such as your operating system, run on any device capable of processing code. This includes hardware, like a cell phone, or your laptop, or a tablet. But programs can also be run by other programs. This is what happens when you play a game in a web browser. Your web browser knows how to run programs written in a programming language called Javascript. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, Python is a programming language, one of many. In order to learn Python programs, you need to download a program that understands that language much like your browser understands Javascript.\n"

If not, you will be able to apply these principles widely when you encounter a new programming language.\n",
